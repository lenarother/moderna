"""
Automated assignment of modular suite names

(copied from the Richardson 2008 papers methods section.)

The above determination of conformer clusters was done by a
consensus of manual examination and evaluations, aided by a
variety of software for smoothing, sorting, and displaying the
multidimensional data. Now that those definitions are on hand,
there is need for an automated algorithm that can closely
approximate those suite name assignments given the list of
consensus clusters and the specific dihedral-angle values for a
new structure. The software developed to do that is called
Suitename, and the input dihedrals can be provided by Dangle
(both available from http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu). The
dihedral-space cluster sizes and shapes are anisotropic, vary
greatly, and are mostly not Gaussian; many include only a small
number of data points; and some of the cluster pairs change
conformational roles at a boundary whose location is not readily
predictable by formula. Therefore, at the current stage of data
and understanding, the assignment algorithm and parameters are
primarily chosen to fit the manual consensus clusters rather than
determined by underlying theory.
For the general case, outer cluster boundaries are treated as
axially oriented ellipsoids, generous enough to include any
plausible data points without danger of entering an entirely
different bin. Each ellipsoid is the same size and shape, but is
centered on the mean of its cluster. The ellipsoid semi-axis in each
coordinate direction is taken as 3*sigma + 15°
, where sigma is the
average of all cluster standard deviations in that dimension. The
first term effectively scales each dimension according to its typical
range of variation, while the constant term allows for underlying
measurement uncertainties. The ellipsoid half-widths are 28° in delta,
35° in gamma, 50° in alpha, 55° in zeta, 60° in epsilon, and 70° in beta.
As noted above, data points segregate into delta and gamma bins nearly
independently of other angles, so the first step of the algorithm is
to place the data point in one of the 12 d(i-1)dg groups or else
declare it an outlier. Two ranges are accepted in d: 55°–110° (C39)
or 120°–175° (C29), and three in g: 20°–95° (p), 140°–215° (t), or
260°–335° (m), jointly defining the 12 groups. d values near zero
have been found to signify incorrect ribose stereochemistry (at
C39 for dr0004/1ET4 a212 and dr0010/1NTB b112 in the RNA05
data set), while values of e outside the range 155°–310° are usually
found to signify a misfit sugar pucker; both of these cases are
noted specifically by Suitename, as well as being named outliers.
Outliers are also declared for b outside 50°–290° or for a or z
outside 25°–335°. These single-angle outliers are referred to as
triaged.
Given the data point’s d(i-1)dg group, the next step operates in
the remaining four dimensions e, z, a, and b, to find all clusters of
which the data point could potentially be a member (that is, for
which it lies within that cluster’s ellipsoid); there may be zero, one,
or several. The scaled four-dimensional distance of the data point
from a cluster mean is zero at the mean and 1.0 anywhere on the
surface of the ellipsoid. In our initial version it was computed as a
Euclidean distance, with each component normalized by the semiaxis
in that dimension. In most cases, a data point belongs to the
cluster to which it is nearest by scaled 4D distance; this is
equivalent to drawing a boundary plane halfway between cluster
means, perpendicular to the line joining them in the scaled ezab
space. The point was given that nearest cluster’s suite name.
In order to capture more of the clearly positive manual
assignments, we found it desirable for Suitename to include
points more generously near the diagonal directions than along
the coordinate axes. This is done using a superellipsoid, the
multidimensional generalization of the superellipse (Gielis 2003)
or Lame´ oval (Gridgeman 1970). This figure bulges smoothly
outward progressively more from an ellipse into the corners of the
superscribed rectangle as the exponent increases from 2. Suitename
uses an exponent (n) of 3, in the superellipsoid equation:

|epsilon/a|^n + |zeta/b|^n + |alpha/c|^n + |beta/d|^n = 1

where a, b, c, and d are the half-widths for the relevant dihedral
angles. The data point clusters, even in the clash and B-filtered
data, show significant diagonal spread (usually in more than just
two dimensions, but not always the same ones) for highly
populated clusters such as 1a, 1c, or 1g, an effect presumably
produced either by real correlated motions or by correlated errors.
Adding the superellipsoid functionality to Suitename is still an
approximation to the probable form of the distribution in
dihedral-angle space, but it significantly improves the coverage
of what seem to be the genuine cluster boundaries.
A few very close cluster groupings require an additional
modification as well: Five dominant clusters (1a, 1c, 1b, 0a, and
6n), each in a different d(i-1)dg group, have satellite clusters with
more than half-overlapped superellipsoids. The estimated boundary
plane that was found to divide conformational types can lie
as much as four times farther from the dominant than from the
satellite cluster mean (e.g., for 1a vs. 1L). Point membership
between such pairs is decided by comparing 4D distances further
scaled in the relevant dimension (or occasionally two dimensions)
by the same ratio as of the two distances from the cluster means to
the boundary plane. If a data point is potentially a member of
more than two clusters, first its closest nondominant cluster is
found using the standard-case algorithm with default scalings, and
then the asymmetric comparison is made with the dominant
cluster if there is one. Each non-outlier suite in the input structure
is thus assigned a modular name.
To evaluate the match quality of a data point to its assigned conformational
cluster, a scaled 7D superellipsoid distance (analogous
to the 4D formula above) is now computed in all seven dihedral
dimensions of the suite, including d(i-1), g, and d as well as e, z, a,
and b. That distance d is then converted into a ‘‘suiteness’’ match
quality s, according to s = ((cos pi*d) +1) /2, which varies sinusoidally
from 1.0 at the cluster mean to zero at the surface of the
superellipsoid. A floor of 0.01 is imposed so all non-outlier points
have non-zero suiteness. All outliers have suiteness=0. The suiteness
is a measure of how well the detailed local backbone conformation
fits one of the most commonly observed (and thus presumably
most favorable) conformational clusters.
