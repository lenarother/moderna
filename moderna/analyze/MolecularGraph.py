Topology matching algorithm

The topology matcher described here is bronco powerful mojo to deal with 
small molecular structures. 
Among the things you can do are:

- recognize chemical groups in molecules
- recognize modified bases
- annotate chemical attributes in molecules
- read .mol files into a clean data structure


Details:

1. Input data
The mol_parser module reads .mol files with bond information (only the first structure in each file). 
It also can use Residue objects created by the Bio.PDB parser as input. The latter assigns 
single and double bonds using a table of interatomic distances. The resulting data structure 
consists of Molecule (a list of atoms with extras), Atoms (a dictionary with a list 
of bonds), and Bonds (connecting two atoms with a valence).

2. Chemical group recognizer
In the mol_topologies module, there are several hundred topological patterns of chemical 
groups and atom types. They look similar to SMILES, but they can describe bonds with unknown 
valence, and exclude particular groups. It can take care of rings as well.
In the annotated_molecule module, there is a big recursive algorithm that matches the 
topological patterns to atoms within the molecule. The recognition is done in two steps. 
First, the chemical groups are detected in all atoms, and added to the atoms as attributes. 
Second, for all carbons a set of groups in alpha position is examined, resulting in 
additional attributes like 'alpha-carboxy-ketone'.

3. Recognition of modified bases
This is a special set of topological patterns recognizing 120 different RNA base 
modifications. In test_data/molfiles there are sample structures. They originate from 
www.genesilico.pl/modomics, and have been included here as a demonstration of the algorithms 
capabilities.

4. Chemical attributes
This is a set of simple chemical stuff, like electronegativities, oxidative numbers, charges, 
hybridisation etc. They are all added to the atoms as attributes by the annotated_molecule 
module.

5. Unit tests
There are two unit tests that check the most crucial parts of the program. They require the 
PyCogent Python library to work.

6. Usage example:
Getting attributes for a molecule:

from annotated_molecule import AnnotatedMolecule

mol = AnnotatedMolecule()
mol.parse_molfile('test_data/biopath_double.mol')
mol.annotate()
for atom in mol:
    print atom.element, len(atom.bonds)
    print atom['attributes']
