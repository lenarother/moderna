Installation Instructions
=========================

1. Quick guide
--------------
 
   python setup.py install

2. Requirements
---------------

ModeRNA runs on any modern Windows or Linux PC. It requires the Biopython library.

3. Installation on Linux
------------------------

To install ModeRNA on Linux, you need to:

- Download the source distribution [Moderna Version 1.7.1 (source)].

- Unzip the archive. A catalog with the main program moderna.py is created.

- Make sure Python 2.6 or a higher version is installed. (on Ubuntu Linux, use sudo apt-get install python.

- Make sure Numpy is installed (sudo apt-get install python-numpy).

- Make sure BioPython is installed (sudo apt-get install python-biopython).
   (tested with BioPython 1.53-1.58)

- Make sure the moderna/moderna.py file is executable:
  chmod a+x moderna/moderna.py

- Add the path to the moderna directory to your PYTHONPATH variable,e.g.:
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/lena/moderna/

- run:
  python setup.py install

- After this, you can from any location write:

python
>>> from moderna.moderna import *


4. Installing ModeRNA on Windows
--------------------------------

To install ModeRNA on Windows, you need to:

- Download the source distribution [Moderna Version 1.7.1 (source)].

- Unzip the archive. A catalog with the main program moderna.py is created.

- Make sure that these libraries are installed:
    (all available from iimcb.genesilico.pl/moderna)
    Python 2.6 or a higher
    Numpy
    BioPython (tested with BioPython 1.53 - 1.58)

- Run from the terminal:
  C:/Python26/python.exe setup.py install

- After this, you can write in the Python shell:

>>> from moderna.moderna import *

Joanna Kasprzak, Jurek Orlowski, Pawel Lukasz, Tomasz Osinski, Marcin 
Domagalski, Anna Czerwoniec, Stanislaw Dunin-Horkavic, Marcin Skorupski, 
and Marcin Feder for their comments and constructive criticism during 
development. 

The PDB parser ued by Moderna uses BioPython with kind support by 
Thomas Hamelryck. The unit test framework was brought near to us by 
Sandra Smit, Rob Knight, and Gavin Huttley. We also would like to thank 
Neocles Leontis, Fabrice Jossinet, Francois Major, and Eric Westhof who 
provided helpful advice on various occasions.
Special thanks go to the group of Russ Altman, who provided us with 
their modeling example to test ModeRNA.
