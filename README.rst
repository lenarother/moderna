Installation Instructions
=========================

0. Quick guide
--------------
 
   python setup.py install

1. Requirements
---------------

ModeRNA runs on any modern Windows or Linux PC. There are two versions available:

- Source code - full functionality, but requires some libraries.
- Windows Binary - easy to install, but limited functionality.


2. Installing the Windows Binary
-------------------------------- 
All you need to do is:

- Download the latest binary [Moderna Version 1.5.0 (.exe)].

- Unzip the archive.

- Open a command line window and switch to the unzipped directory. Type 

  python moderna.py -h 

  to see available options.


3. Installation on Linux
------------------------

To install ModeRNA on Linux, you need to:

- Download the source distribution [Moderna Version 1.5.2 (source)].

- Unzip the archive. A catalog with the main program moderna.py is created.

- Make sure Python 2.5 or a higher version is installed. (on Ubuntu Linux, use sudo apt-get install python.

- Make sure Numpy is installed (sudo apt-get install python-numpy).

- Make sure BioPython is installed (sudo apt-get install python-biopython).
   (tested with BioPython 1.51-1.53)

- Make sure the moderna/moderna.py file is executable:
  chmod a+x moderna/moderna.py

- Add the path to the moderna directory to your PYTHONPATH variable,e.g. 

- run:
  python setup.py install

- After this, you can from any location write:

python
>>> from moderna.moderna import *


4. Installing ModeRNA on Windows
--------------------------------

To install ModeRNA on Windows, you need to:

- Download the source distribution [Moderna Version 1.5.2 (source)].

- Unzip the archive. A catalog with the main program moderna.py is created.

- Make sure that these libraries are installed:
    (all available from iimcb.genesilico.pl/moderna)
    Python 2.5 or a higher
    Numpy
    BioPython (tested with BioPython 1.51-1.53)

- Run from the terminal:
  C:/Python25/python.exe setup.py install

- After this, you can write in the Python shell:

>>> from moderna.moderna import *

Joanna Kasprzak, Jurek Orlowski, Pawel Lukasz, Tomasz Osinski, Marcin 
Domagalski, Anna Czerwoniec, Stanislaw Dunin-Horkavic, Marcin Skorupski, 
and Marcin Feder for their comments and constructive criticism during 
development. 

The PDB parser ued by Moderna uses BioPython with kind support by 
Thomas Hamelryck. The unit test framework was brought near to us by 
Sandra Smit, Rob Knight, and Gavin Huttley. We also would like to thank 
Neocles Leontis, Fabrice Jossinet, Francois Major, and Eric Westhof who 
provided helpful advice on various occasions.
Special thanks go to the group of Russ Altman, who provided us with 
their modeling example to test ModeRNA.

============================
Notes from pyscaffold README
============================

This project was set up with PyScaffold 0.9.
Following features are available:

Packaging
=========

Run ``python setup.py sdist``, ``python setup.py bdist`` or
``python setup.py bdist_wheel`` to build a source, binary or wheel
distribution.


Complete Git Integration
========================

Your project is already an initialised Git repository and ``setup.py`` uses
the information of tags to infer the version of your project with the help of
`versioneer <https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer>`_.
To use this feature you need to tag with the format ``vMAJOR.MINOR[.REVISION]``
, e.g. ``v0.0.1`` or ``v0.1``. The prefix ``v`` is needed!
Run ``python setup.py version`` to retrieve the current `PEP440
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/>`_-compliant version. This version
will be used when building a package and is also accessible through
``my_project.__version__``.
The version will be ``unknown`` until you have added a first tag.


Sphinx Documentation
====================

Build the documentation with ``python setup.py docs`` and run doctests with
``python setup.py doctest``. Start editing the file ``docs/index.rst`` to
extend the documentation.


Unittest & Coverage
===================

Run ``python setup.py test`` to run all unittests defined in the subfolder
``tests`` with the help of `py.test <http://pytest.org/>`_. The py.test plugin
`pytest-cov <https://github.com/schlamar/pytest-cov>`_ is used to automatically
generate a coverage report. For usage with a continuous integration software
JUnit and Coverage XML output can be activated. Checkout ``putup -h`` for
details.

Requirements Management
=======================

Add the requirements of your project to the ``requirements.txt`` file which
will be automatically used by ``setup.py``.


Easy Updating
=============

Keep your project's scaffold up-to-date by applying
``putput --update my_project`` when a new version of PyScaffold was released.
It may also be used to change the url, license and description setting.
